This is a project which involves 
i.   Extracting data by downloading csv files through a link using bash script
ii.  The extracted file is further transformed by removing certain features
iii. The transformed data is loaded into a folder
iv.  Writing a Bash script to move all CSV and JSON files from one folder to another folder named json_and_CSV. 
     Use any Json and CSV of your choice, the script should be able to work with one or more Json and CSV files.
v.   Downloading a zipped folder containing csv files of parch and posey database.   
     Writinge a Bash script that iterates over and copies each of the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database (name the database posey)

The solutions to these questions were documented using a well-detailed README file. 
Upload all scripts (bash and sql) into a folder named Scripts. 
Inside the Scripts folder, create separate folders to store the Bash scripts and SQL scripts. 
Push all work to GitHub (do not push the CSV files). 
Ensure that you do not push directly to the master branch but instead merge to master via a pull request. 

NB: Everything is to be done on the command line
